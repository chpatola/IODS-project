### My thoughts about the course

I am exited about this course and eager to learn more about the statistics behind machine learning and the different algorithms.  I heard about this course when I took a couple of summer courses that Kimmo had.

This is my GitHub repository: [link](https://github.com/chpatola/IODS-project)

### Week 2

I have taken some courses where regressionhas been a topic before, so this was not so many new things. However, alway good to repeat.
